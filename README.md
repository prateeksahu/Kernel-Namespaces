Set of basic scripts to test out various namespace features in Linux Kernel.

Each folder has its own README which guides you on how to get the PoCs running.

Run the `setup.sh` to install basic tooling required in the PoCs.

The scripts have been largely borrowed from [Demystifying containers Part 1- Kernel Space](https://www.suse.com/c/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space/) by Sascha Grunert.
